# BTWi-fi_login
Login Script for BTWi-Fi

some features need to be added which is described in the script


this is used on raspian to login over Wi-Fi to BT Hotspots and with iptables rules
to masquerade all traffic from eth0 is directed to wlan0


next updates are to make sure the iptables rules are set and other config within the interfaces file 
so just running this script can be used for inital setup or continuation of internet service
